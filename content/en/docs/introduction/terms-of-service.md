These Terms of Service (the “Agreement”) explain the terms and conditions by which you may access and use [STARFLEIT Web Application](https://app.starfleit.io), a website-hosted user interface (the “Interface” or “App”) provided by [DELIGHT LABS](https://delightlabs.io) (“we”, “our”, or “us”). You must read this Agreement carefully as it governs your use of the Interface. By accessing or using the Interface, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety. If you do not agree, you are not authorized to access or use the Interface and should not use the Interface.

**NOTICE: This Agreement contains important information, including a binding arbitration provision and a class action waiver, both of which impact your rights as to how disputes are resolved. The Interface is only available to you — and you should only access the Interface — if you agree completely with these terms.**

## Introduction

The Interface provides access to a decentralized protocol on the Fetch.ai network, that allows users to trade certain compatible digital assets (“the STARFLEIT protocol” or the “Protocol”). The Interface is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol.

To access the Interface, you must use non-custodial wallet software, which allows you to interact with the Fetch.ai network. Your relationship with that non-custodial wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of service of that third party, not this Agreement. Wallets are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with us, and we do not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and have no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. By connecting your wallet to our Interface, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and all of the terms incorporated herein by reference.

## Modification of this Agreement

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify this Agreement from time to time. If we make any material modifications, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of the Agreement and by maintaining a current version of the Agreement at [Terms of Service](https://docs.starfleit.io/docs/introduction/terms-of-service). All modifications will be effective when they are posted, and your continued accessing or use of the Interface will serve as confirmation of your acceptance of those modifications. If you do not agree with any modifications to this Agreement, you must immediately stop accessing and using the Interface.

## Description of Services provided through the Interface

The Interface provides a web or mobile-based means of accessing the Protocol.

The Interface is distinct from the Protocol and is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol. The Protocol itself comprises open-source or source-available self-executing smart contracts that are deployed on the Fetch.ai network. We do not operate the Protocol on the Fetch.ai network. By using the Interface, you understand that you are not buying or selling digital assets from us and that we do not operate any liquidity pools on the Protocol or control trade execution on the Protocol. When traders pay fees for trades, those fees accrue to liquidity providers for the Protocol. As a general matter, we are not a liquidity provider into Protocol liquidity pools and liquidity providers are independent third parties.

Please note that digital assets that have been “bridged” or “wrapped” to operate on other blockchain networks are distinct from the original Fetch.ai mainnet asset.

## Eligibility

To access or use the Interface, you must be able to form a legally binding contract with us. Accordingly, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction and have the full right, power, and authority to enter into and comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement on behalf of yourself and any company or legal entity for which you may access or use the Interface.

You further represent that you are not **(a)** the subject of economic or trade sanctions administered or enforced by any governmental authority or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties including but not limited to the lists maintained by the relevant authorities of the Republic of Korea, the United States, the United Kingdom, or the European Union; or **(b)** a citizen, resident, or organized in a jurisdiction or territory that is the subject of comprehensive country-wide, territory-wide, or regional economic sanctions by the Republic of Korea, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union or other relevant jurisdictions. Finally, you represent that your access and use of the Interface will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations and that you will not access or use the Interface to conduct, promote, or otherwise facilitate any illegal activity.

## Intellectual Property Rights

We own all intellectual property and other rights in the Interface and its contents, including (but not limited to) software, text, images, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, designs, and its “look and feel.” This intellectual property is available under the terms of our copyright licenses and our Trademark Guidelines. Unlike the Interface, the Protocol is comprised entirely of open-source or source-available software running on the Fetch.ai network.

## Additional Rights

We reserve the following rights, which do not constitute obligations of ours: **(a)** with or without notice to you, to modify, substitute, eliminate or add to the Interface; **(b)** to review, modify, filter, disable, delete and remove any and all content and information from the Interface; and **(c)** to cooperate with any law enforcement, court or government investigation or order or third party requesting or directing that we disclose information or content or information that you provide.

## Prohibited Activity

You agree not to engage in, or attempt to engage in, any of the following categories of prohibited activity in relation to your access and use of the Interface:

- **Intellectual Property Infringement.** Activity that infringes on or violates any copyright, trademark, service mark, patent, right of publicity, right of privacy, or other proprietary or intellectual property rights under the law.
- **Cyberattack.** Activity that seeks to interfere with or compromise the integrity, security, or proper functioning of any computer, server, network, personal device, or other information technology system, including (but not limited to) the deployment of viruses and denial of service attacks.
- **Fraud and Misrepresentation.** Activity that seeks to defraud us or any other person or entity, including (but not limited to) providing any false, inaccurate, or misleading information in order to unlawfully obtain the property of another.
- **Market Manipulation.** Activity that violates any applicable law, rule, or regulation concerning the integrity of trading markets, including (but not limited to) the manipulative tactics commonly known as “rug pulls”, pumping and dumping, and wash trading.
- **Securities and Derivatives Violations.** Activity that violates any applicable law, rule, or regulation concerning the trading of securities or derivatives, including (but not limited to) the unregistered offering of securities and the offering of leveraged and margined commodity products to retail customers in the relevant jurisdiction.
- **Sale of Stolen Property.** Buying, selling, or transferring of stolen items, fraudulently obtained items, items taken without authorization, and/or any other illegally obtained items.
- **Data Mining or Scraping.** Activity that involves data mining, robots, scraping, or similar data gathering or extraction methods of content or information from the Interface.
- **Objectionable Content.** Activity that involves soliciting information from anyone under the age of 18 or that is otherwise harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, excessively violent, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, pornographic, libelous, invasive of another’s privacy, hateful, discriminatory, or otherwise objectionable.
- **Any Other Unlawful Conduct.** Activity that violates any applicable law, rule, or regulation of a relevant jurisdiction.

## Not Registered with the SEC or Any Other Agency

We are not registered as a securities exchange with a regulatory authority in pertinent jurisdictions or in any other capacity. You understand and acknowledge that we do not broker trading orders on your behalf nor do we collect or earn fees from your trades on the Interface. We also do not facilitate the execution or settlement of your trades, which occur entirely on the public distributed blockchain, which is the Fetch.ai network. As a result, we do not(and cannot) guarantee market best pricing or best execution through the Interface or when using our Auto Routing feature, which routes trades across liquidity pools on the Protocol only. Any references in the Interface to “best price“ do not a representation or warranty about pricing available through the Interface, on the Protocol, or elsewhere.

## Non-Solicitation; No Investment Advice

**You agree and understand that**<br>
**a.** all trades you submit through the Interface are considered unsolicited, which means that they are solely initiated by you.<br>
**b.** you have not received any investment advice from us in connection with any trades, including those you place via our Auto Routing API.<br>
**c.** we do not conduct a suitability review of any trades you submit.

We may provide information about tokens in the Interface sourced from third-party data partners through features such as token explorer. We may provide verified labels or warning dialogs for certain tokens. The provision of informational materials does not make trades in those tokens solicited; we are not attempting to induce you to make any purchase as a result of the information provided. All such information provided by the Interface is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice or a recommendation that a particular token is a safe or sound investment. You should not take, or refrain from taking, any action based on any information contained in the Interface. By providing token information for your convenience, we do not make any investment recommendations to you or opine on the merits of any transaction or opportunity. You alone are responsible for determining whether any investment, investment strategy, or related transaction is appropriate for you based on your personal investment objectives, financial circumstances, and risk tolerance.

## Non-Custodial and No Fiduciary Duties

The Interface is a purely non-custodial application, meaning we do not ever have custody, possession, or control of your digital assets at any time. It further means you are solely responsible for the custody of the cryptographic private keys to the digital asset wallets you hold and you should never share your wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone. We accept no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of a wallet and make no representations or warranties regarding how the Interface will operate with any specific wallet.

Likewise, you are solely responsible for any associated wallet and we are not liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with or as a result of your wallet being compromised.

This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that we owe no fiduciary duties or liabilities to you or any other party, and that to the extent any such duties or liabilities may exist at law or in equity, those duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and eliminated. You further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are those set out expressly in this Agreement.

## Compliance and Tax Obligations

The Interface may not be available or appropriate for use in your jurisdiction. By accessing or using the Interface, you agree that you are solely and entirely responsible for compliance with all laws and regulations that may apply to you.

Specifically, your use of the Interface or the Protocol may result in various tax consequences, such as income or capital gains tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, or sales tax in certain jurisdictions.

It is your responsibility to determine whether taxes apply to any transactions you initiate or receive and, if so, to report and/or remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.

## Assumption of Risk

By accessing and using the Interface, you represent that you are financially and technically sophisticated enough to understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems including automated market making smart contract systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of digital assets such as FET, so-called stablecoins, and other digital tokens such as those following the Cosmwasm Token Spec (CW-20).

In particular, you understand that the markets for these digital assets are nascent and highly volatile due to risk factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You understand that anyone can create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens. So-called stablecoins may not be as stable as they purport to be, may not be fully or adequately collateralized, and may be subject to panics and runs.

Further, you understand that smart contract transactions automatically execute and settle, and that blockchain-based transactions are irreversible when confirmed. You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as Fetch.ai network are variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge and accept the risk of trading with additional parameters' settings (slippage tolerance, auto-router, and transaction deadline), which can expose you to potentially significant price slippage and higher costs.

If you act as a liquidity provider to the Protocol through the Interface, you understand that your digital assets may lose some or all of their value while they are supplied to the Protocol through the Interface due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a trading pair or liquidity pool.

Finally, you understand that we do not make any representation or warranty about the safety or soundness of any cross-chain bridge.

In summary, you acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks, do not own or control the Protocol, and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using the Interface. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the Interface to interact with the Protocol.

## Third-Party Resources and Promotions

The Interface may contain references or links to third-party resources, including (but not limited to) information, materials, products, or services, that we do not own or control. In addition, third parties may offer promotions related to your access and use of the Interface. We do not approve, monitor, endorse, warrant or assume any responsibility for any such resources or promotions. If you access any such resources or participate in any such promotions, you do so at your own risk, and you understand that this Agreement does not apply to your dealings or relationships with any third parties. You expressly relieve us of any and all liability arising from your use of any such resources or participation in any such promotions.

## Release of Claims

You expressly agree that you assume all risks in connection with your access and use of the Interface. You further expressly waive and release us from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way relating to your use of the Interface. If you are a California resident, you waive the benefits and protections of California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: “\[a\] general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”

## Indemnity

You agree to hold harmless, release, defend, and indemnify us and our officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, and subsidiaries from and against all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses arising from: **(a)** your access and use of the Interface; **(b)** your violation of any term or condition of this Agreement, the right of any third party, or any other applicable law, rule, or regulation; and **(c)** any other party's access and use of the Interface with your assistance or using any device or account that you own or control.

## No Warranties

The Interface is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. **TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.** You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Interface is at your own risk. We do not represent or warrant that access to the Interface will be continuous, uninterrupted, timely, or secure; that the information contained in the Interface will be accurate, reliable, complete, or current; or that the Interface will be free from errors, defects, viruses, or other harmful elements. No advice, information, or statement that we make should be treated as creating any warranty concerning the Interface. We do not endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any advertisements, offers, or statements made by third parties concerning the Interface.

Similarly, the Protocol is provided “AS IS”, at your own risk, and without warranties of any kind. No developer or entity involved in creating the Protocol will be liable for any claims or damages whatsoever associated with your use, inability to use, or your interaction with other users of, the Protocol, including any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, or loss of profits, cryptocurrencies, tokens, or anything else of value. We do not endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any advertisements, offers, or statements made by third parties concerning the Interface.

## Limitation of Liability

*UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL WE OR ANY OF OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS, AFFILIATES, OR SUBSIDIARIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE PROPERTY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY ACCESS OR USE OF THE INTERFACE, NOR WILL WE BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS, OR INJURY RESULTING FROM HACKING, TAMPERING, OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF THE INTERFACE OR THE INFORMATION CONTAINED WITHIN IT. WE ASSUME NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY: **(A)** ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT; **(B)** PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, RESULTING FROM ANY ACCESS OR USE OF THE INTERFACE; **(C)** UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF ANY SECURE SERVER OR DATABASE IN OUR CONTROL, OR THE USE OF ANY INFORMATION OR DATA STORED THEREIN; **(D)** INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF FUNCTION RELATED TO THE INTERFACE; **(E)** BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE THAT MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH THE INTERFACE; **(F)** ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN, OR LOSS OR DAMAGE INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF, ANY CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE INTERFACE; AND **(G)** THE DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY.*

## Dispute Resolution

We will use our best efforts to resolve any potential disputes through informal, good faith negotiations. If a potential dispute arises, you must contact us by sending an email to [contact@starfleit.io](mailto:contact@starfleit.io) so that we can attempt to resolve it without resorting to formal dispute resolution. If we aren\'t able to reach an informal resolution within sixty days of your email, then you and we both agree to resolve the potential dispute according to the process set forth below.

Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Interface, this Agreement, or any other acts or omissions for which you may contend that we are liable, including (but not limited to) any claim or controversy as to arbitrability(“Dispute”), shall be finally and exclusively settled by arbitration in accordance with the International Arbitration Rules of the Korean Commercial Arbitration Board(KCAB Rules). The number of arbitrators shall be three. The seat, or legal place, of arbitral proceedings shall be Seoul/Republic of Korea. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. Unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate your claims with those of any other party. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

## Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver

You must bring any and all Disputes against us in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff in or member of any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding. This provision applies to class arbitration. You and we both agree to waive the right to demand a trial by jury.

## Governing Law
You agree that the laws of the Republic of Korea, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, govern this Agreement and any Dispute between you and us. You further agree that the Interface shall be deemed to be based solely in the Republic of Korea, and that although the Interface may be available in other jurisdictions, its availability does not give rise to general or specific personal jurisdiction in any forum outside the Republic of Korea. Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Agreement shall be governed by the Arbitration Act of the Republic of Korea. You agree that the courts of the Republic of Korea are the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for court proceedings in the event that this Agreement&apos;s binding clause is found to be unenforceable.

## Entire Agreement

These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings (if any) relating to the subject matter of the terms.
