## Participants

Users can participate in STARFLEIT as traders, liquidity providers, or both.

### Trader

A **trader** can exchange their tokens for other tokens through STARFLEIT using the price determined by the liquidity pool ratio.

### Liquidity Provider

A **liquidity provider** adds equal value of two assets to their corresponding STARFLEIT pair pool, increasing the liquidity for the corresponding pair market while maintaining the pool price. In this process, liquidity providers are rewarded by newly minted LP tokens. LP tokens represent the liquidity provider's share in the pool and provide the benefit of earning trading fees, which are accumulated into the pool on every swap transaction. Liquidity providers can burn their LP tokens to withdraw their share from the pool.
